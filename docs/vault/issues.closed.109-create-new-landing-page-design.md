Well before the Imba v2 release, we want to have a brand new landing page that links to the various things. This page should intrigue you try out Imba or easily find useful links. Also, the new slogan has to be prominent/visible. 


### Some Links

Listed the ones I remember but probably more could be added.

- Imba Changelog
- Imba Bi-Weekly Community Meeting
- docs.imba.io
- etc.
