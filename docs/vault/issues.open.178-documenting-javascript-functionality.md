Should we include things inherited from javascript like Object and Array methods? The options would be:
- Do not include
- Included one reference to mdn per main topic like [Objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
- list the individual methods, etc deep linking to their corresponding mdn article - [assign](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign), .., [keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys)
- add our own documentation
