This will ideally come with lots of examples but the reader should have the option to change anything inside of the playground. 



I think this way we can provide complete examples and explain concepts more interactively.



[Svelte](https://svelte.dev) has a great examples section that we can model this after https://svelte.dev/examples#hello-world



Can we embed Scrimba playgrounds for this @somebee?
