Just a minor suggestion... In page:

http://imba.io/guides/essentials/state-management#state-management

https://github.com/imba/imba.io/blob/master/guide/1-Essentials/state-management.md

"unoppinionated" is not an actual word. "not opinionated" (only one 'p') is probably a better option ;)

Keep up the excellent work.
