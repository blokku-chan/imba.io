If we update the overview page of the v2 documentation, it can be good enough to serve as a landing page for now. Here's what I think should change:

- [ ] Show a dedicated overview page, without the 'basic syntax' stuff appearing on the same page
- [ ] Improve the description
- [ ] Maybe remove the 'this is a WIP' banner at the top for this page?
- [ ] Include a few code examples meant to be more enticing than educational.
