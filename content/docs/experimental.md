# Experimental

The following features of Imba are considered experimental. These
features do not affect the stability of Imba's core scripting and UI
building features, which remains in production use by multiple
companies, namely [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com). However, expect that
these experimental features are subject to syntax changes and
sometimes removal in favor of better features, and also potential
bugs.
