# Scripting

Imba isn't a framework, it's a full language with zero friction
JavaScript interoperability that also ships with built in UI support.
You can use it for the same things you'd use JavaScript or Python for,
and you may find that Imba's syntax alone is enough to justify its use
for scripting.
