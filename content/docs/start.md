Imba. Scrimba consists of interactive screencasts where you can pause
and edit the code while you learn.

### Imba VSCode Plugin

Imba's
[VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scrimba.vsimba)
is highly recommended. The extension gives you full-featured tooling
when using Imba, including autocomplete for css shortcuts.
