# Getting Started

The easiest way to get started with Imba is to use `npx` to get a brand-new project up and running.

```sh
npx imba create my-app
```

Follow the instructions to complete the fresh install.

### Full example

```sh
npx imba create my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm start
```

This will create a brand new app using the latest version of Imba and run it with hot reloading. Edit the `/app/client.imba` file to get started.
s
To create a build version of the app for deployment, simply run:

```sh
npm build
```

### Useful tools

We thoroughly recommend using our Visual Studio Code integration which has fantastic tooling when using Imba - including autocomplete for css shortcuts.
