# Smart, Beautiful, Minimal

Imba's syntax is minimal, beautiful, and packed with clever features. Less keystrokes, and less switching files means you'll be able to build things fast.

> There is no hidden code or stylesheets here. What you see is what you get.

# Full-stack language

Imba is neither an academic exercise or a toy project. We've built Imba over many years to build the frontend *and* backend of scrimba.com. Our goal has always been to create the most fun and powerful language for creating rich web applications.

[demo](/examples/express/app.imba?dir=1&preview=md&windowed=1&title=HN%20Clone&url=https://simple-hn.imba.io/top)

Imba works just as well on the server as on the client. It interoperates fully with the npm + node ecosystem. The whole stack of [scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com) is written in Imba.

# Styling Evolved

Inspired by tailwind, Imba brings styles directly into your code. Styles can be scoped to files, components, and even parts of your tag trees. [Style modifiers](/docs/css/modifiers) like `@hover`, `@lg`, `@landscape` and `@dark` can be used for extremely concise yet powerful styling.

[demo](/examples/simple-clock?&windowed=1&title=Clocks&ar=1)

Styles can also be set directly on elements. Inline styles works with all modifiers.

# Blazing fast, Zero config

Imba comes with a built-in bundler based on the blazing fast [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). Import stylesheets, images, typescript, html, workers and more without any configuration. Bundling is so fast that there is no difference between production and development mode - it all happens on-demand.

# Getting Started

Getting started with Imba is as simple as running `npx imba create hello-world` in your terminal to create a new imba project based on a simple template.

Make sure to install the [VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scrimba.vsimba). It provides fantastic auto-completion with type inference, style previews, semantic coloring and much more. Read the [documentation](/docs/intro) for a thorough introduction to the language.

# Basic Syntax [quick-tour]

```imba
let number = 42
let bool = yes

# strings
let string = 'the answer is 42'
let dynamic = "the answer is {number}"
let template = `the answer is {number}`

# dimensions
let length = 20px
let duration = 150ms

let regex = /answer is (\d+)/
let array = [1,2,3]
let object = {name: 'Imba', type: 'language'}
```

```imba
class Todo
    # properties
    prop title
    prop completed = no
    prop due = null

    # methods
    def complete
        completed = yes

    # getters
    get overdue
        due and due < new Date

let todo = new Todo title: 'Read introduction'
```

```imba
# elements are first class citizens
const list = <ul title="reminders">
    <li> "Remember milk"
    <li> "Greet visitor"

# setting classes on elements
<div.panel.large> "Hello world"
# setting dynamic and conditional classes
<div.panel.state-{state} .hidden=condition> "Panel"
# binding handlers (with modifiers)
<div.panel @click.prevent=handler> "Panel"
```

```imba
# looping over iterables
for {id,name} of iterable
    "{name} has id {id}"

# looping over Object.keys/values pairs
for own key,value of object
    [key,value]

# fast looping over arrays
for member,index in array
    member
```
